# Research Documents

This folder contains research findings, data analysis, and calculations that inform the specifications and designs.

## Organization

Research docs are organized by topic and date (when time-sensitive).

### Current Research

*None yet - create as you gather data and perform analysis*

### Planned Research

Based on [Development Roadmap](../00-development-roadmap.md):

#### Energy System Research
- [ ] Solar resource assessment for Western Sahara
- [ ] Solar resource assessment for Baja Peninsula
- [ ] Wind resource assessment for target sites
- [ ] Desalination technology efficiency comparison
- [ ] Energy storage technology comparison
- [ ] Renewable energy cost analysis

#### Water System Research
- [ ] Seawater composition analysis
- [ ] Irrigation efficiency for different crop types
- [ ] Water demand modeling (seasonal)
- [ ] Greywater treatment options

#### Agriculture Research
- [ ] Crop yields in similar climates
- [ ] Aquaponics system performance data
- [ ] Livestock feed efficiency (seaweed-based)
- [ ] Composting rates and methods

#### Site Research
- [ ] Western Sahara terrain and geology
- [ ] Baja Peninsula terrain and geology
- [ ] Local material availability
- [ ] Climate data (temperature, humidity, precipitation)
- [ ] Existing infrastructure proximity
