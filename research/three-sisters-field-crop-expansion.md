# Three Sisters Field Crop Expansion - Research Document

**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Status:** Planning
**Related Priority:** [Homestead-Scale Integrated System](homestead-scale-system.md) expansion pathway

---

## Research Question

What infrastructure, water capacity, and system modifications are needed to expand the homestead-scale integrated system with Three Sisters (corn, beans, squash) field crops, and how does this expansion justify adding Multi-Effect Distillation (MED) to the desalination system?

---

## Executive Summary

Three Sisters agriculture represents a natural expansion pathway for the homestead system that justifies scaling water production from 0.5 m³/day to 5-10 m³/day. At this scale, Multi-Effect Distillation (MED) becomes economically viable and provides critical benefits: 84% more fresh water, 70% less brine volume, and dramatic evaporation pond area reduction (2,000 m² → 600 m²).

**Key Finding:** A 1,000 m² Three Sisters plot requires 4 m³/day irrigation, bringing total system demand to 4.5 m³/day - exactly the threshold where hybrid RO+MED outperforms RO-only systems.

**Integration Synergies:**
- Corn stalks → Mushroom substrate (replaces purchased straw)
- Spent mushroom substrate + BSFL frass → Field amendments (2-1-2 NPK + micronutrients)
- Gypsum from salt production → Soil conditioner (calcium + sulfur)
- Bean nitrogen fixation → Reduces external fertilizer needs
- Solar thermal infrastructure → Dual-purpose (mushroom pasteurization + MED thermal input)

**Staged Implementation:**
- **Phase 1 (Year 1-2):** Install expandable solar thermal system ($3,700-7,500) for mushroom pasteurization
- **Phase 2 (Year 2-3):** Trial plot 200-500 m² Three Sisters ($2,000-5,000) using existing water capacity
- **Phase 3 (Year 3-4):** Full expansion 1,000-2,000 m² with RO+MED scaling ($65,000-130,000)

**Population Capacity:** Expansion increases food production to support 25-35 people (complete nutrition from aquaponics + livestock + field crops).

## Findings

### Finding 1: Water Requirements Drive MED Viability

**Three Sisters Water Demand:**

**Per m² irrigation needs:**
- Corn: 500-800 mm/season (4-6 months)
- Beans: 300-500 mm/season
- Squash: 400-600 mm/season
- **Intercropped:** 500-650 mm/season (squash mulching reduces evaporation 15-20%)

**1,000 m² plot calculation:**
- Season: 150 days (Oct-May optimal in Baja)
- Total water: 600 mm × 1,000 m² = 600 m³/season
- **Daily irrigation: 4 m³/day**

**Combined system demand:**
- Homestead baseline: 0.39-0.51 m³/day (from homestead-scale-system.md)
- Three Sisters (1,000 m²): 4 m³/day
- **Total: 4.4-4.5 m³/day**

**MED viability threshold:** 5-10 m³/day (from homestead-scale-system.md)
→ **Three Sisters expansion places system at lower MED threshold**

- Disease suppression (chitin triggers SAR - Systemic Acquired Resistance)
- Water holding capacity improvement

#### 3. Gypsum (Calcium Sulfate)

**Production:** Byproduct of salt fractional crystallization

**Source:** RO brine evaporation → CaCO₃ precipitates first (Concentrator 1), then gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O) in Concentrator 2

**Estimated production:**
- Brine input: 0.6 m³/day (current) → 3.6 m³/day (with MED)

**Current mushroom substrate need:** 56 kg/week dry straw (2,912 kg/year)

**Corn stalk availability:** 2,000-3,000 kg/year
→ **68-103% of mushroom substrate carbon needs met from field crop residue!**

**Closed loop:**
```
Three Sisters field
    ↓ (corn stalks after grain harvest)
Mushroom substrate (stalk carbon + livestock manure)
    ↓ (after mushroom harvest)
Spent mushroom substrate
    ↓ (80% to BSFL, 20% to livestock)
BSFL frass
    ↓ (nutrient-rich soil amendment)
Back to Three Sisters field
```

**System efficiency:** Zero external carbon inputs needed once corn production established.

#### 5. Bean Nitrogen Fixation

**N fixation rate:** 50-150 kg N/ha/year from Rhizobium symbiosis

**1,000 m² plot:** 5-15 kg N/year fixed from atmosphere

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Year 1-2)

1. **Install expandable solar thermal system** ($3,700-7,500)
   - Size for future MED use (6 m² collectors, 500 L tank, oversized manifolds)
   - Begin mushroom pasteurization immediately
   - Validate intermittent operation and thermal performance

2. **Accumulate soil amendments**
   - Collect SMS (12 kg/day × 365 = 4,380 kg/year)
   - Collect BSFL frass (3,500 kg/year estimated)
   - Separate gypsum from salt evaporation (Concentrator 2)
   - Store in covered area for Year 2 field application

3. **Conduct soil testing**
   - Test proposed field site for pH, NPK, organic matter, salinity
   - Determine baseline before amendment application
   - Identify any specific deficiencies (micronutrients)

4. **Source Three Sisters seed varieties**
   - Heirloom/open-pollinated for seed saving
   - Desert-adapted or drought-tolerant varieties preferred
   - Corn: Flint or dent varieties (storage quality)
   - Beans: Tepary or pinto (heat tolerance)
   - Squash: Winter squash (storage quality, large leaves for mulching)

---

### Trial Plot Phase (Year 2-3)

1. **Start small: 200-500 m² pilot**
   - Allows learning without large capital commitment
   - Fits within existing water capacity + rainwater
   - Easier to manage pests, adjust irrigation

2. **Apply amendments per research findings**
   - SMS: 5-10 tonnes/ha (500-1,000 kg for 1,000 m² prorated)
   - BSFL frass: 2-5 tonnes/ha (200-500 kg for 1,000 m² prorated)
   - Gypsum: 500-1,000 kg/ha (50-100 kg for 1,000 m² prorated)
   - Incorporate into top 15-30 cm soil before planting

3. **Monitor intensively**
   - Water use: Daily measurement (compare to 4 m³/day estimate)
   - Plant growth: Weekly observations, photographs
   - Pest/disease: Identify issues early, minimal intervention
   - Yields: Harvest weights for corn, beans, squash separately

4. **Test closed-loop pathway**
   - Harvest corn stalks, chop to <10 cm pieces
   - Mix with manure for mushroom substrate (replace straw)
   - Measure mushroom yield on corn stalk substrate vs straw
   - If yield >80% of straw substrate → viable replacement

5. **Validate assumptions**
   - Are Three Sisters yields within 80% of estimates?
   - Is water use within 10% of 4 m³/day projection?
   - Do amendments improve soil health (organic matter increase)?
   - Are corn stalks viable mushroom substrate?

**Decision point after trial:** Proceed to full expansion if 3+ success criteria met.

---

### Full Expansion Phase (Year 3-4)

**Only proceed if trial demonstrates:**
- ✅ Yields ≥80% of projections
- ✅ Water use ≤4.5 m³/day per 1,000 m²
- ✅ Soil health maintained or improved
- ✅ Closed-loop corn stalk pathway viable

**Implementation sequence:**

1. **Finalize design and permitting**
   - RO system sizing (3 m³/day)
   - MED unit specification (5-10 m³/day)
   - Solar thermal expansion (28 m² total)
   - Solar PV expansion (+30 m²)
   - Evaporation pond redesign (180 m² for concentrated brine)

2. **Procure long-lead items**
   - MED unit (12-16 week lead time typical)
   - RO membranes and pressure vessels (8-12 weeks)
   - Solar thermal collectors (4-8 weeks)
   - Storage tanks (2,000 L, 4-6 weeks)

3. **Install infrastructure (12-18 months)**
   - Month 1-2: Site preparation, excavation for ponds
   - Month 2-4: Solar thermal expansion, tank installation
   - Month 3-6: RO scale-up, plumbing integration
   - Month 6-9: MED installation, commissioning
   - Month 9-12: Solar PV expansion, battery storage
   - Month 12-15: Field preparation (1,000-2,000 m²)
   - Month 15-18: Drip irrigation, water storage tanks

4. **Commission systems sequentially**
   - RO → MED → Thermal cascade → Field irrigation
   - Allow 2-4 weeks between systems for troubleshooting
   - Parallel operation with old RO during transition (redundancy)

5. **Plant Three Sisters**
   - Timing: October-November (cooler season start)
   - Amendment application 2-4 weeks before planting
   - Succession planting (stagger by 2 weeks for continuous harvest)
