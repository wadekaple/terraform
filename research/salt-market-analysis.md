## Executive Summary

**Production:** ~20-25 kg/day food-grade sea salt (~7-9 tonnes/year)

**Market opportunity:** Artisanal salt commands **$20-100/kg** vs commodity at $0.03-0.22/kg — a 100-1000x price premium for the same mineral.

**Key differentiators available:**
- Solar-harvested from pristine Baja Pacific waters
- Sustainability story (desalination byproduct = zero waste)
- Baja regional identity (underutilized compared to Colima)

**Realistic annual revenue potential:**

| Market Tier | Price/kg | Annual Revenue (7 tonnes) |
|-------------|----------|---------------------------|
| Wholesale to distributors | $8-15 | $56,000-105,000 |
| Direct restaurant/chef sales | $15-25 | $105,000-175,000 |
| Retail (online, farmers markets) | $25-50 | $175,000-350,000 |
| Premium positioning | $50-80 | $350,000-560,000 |

## Mexican Domestic Market

### Regulatory Framework

**COFEPRIS** (Federal Commission for Protection Against Sanitary Risks):
- Operates under Secretaría de Salud
- Issues sanitary licenses/permits for food products
- Food-grade salt requires sanitary registration

**Key NOM Standards:**
- **NOM-040-SSA1-1993:** Specifications for food-grade salt (aligned with Codex STAN 150-1985)
- **NOM-051-SCFI/SSA1-2010:** Labeling requirements for pre-packaged foods
- Minimum **97% NaCl content** (dry matter basis)

### Market Size

Latin America Gourmet Salt Market: **$0.71 billion (2024)** → projected **$1.27 billion by 2033** (6.66% CAGR)

Mexico is a primary growth driver alongside Brazil.

### Buyer Segments

| Segment | Characteristics | Access Strategy |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **High-end restaurants** | Mexico City, resort areas, BajaMed cuisine | Chef relationships, Mercado San Juan |
| **Specialty food stores** | CDMX, Guadalajara, Monterrey, Los Cabos | Direct distribution |
| **Resort retail** | Los Cabos, Baja California Sur | Souvenir/gift positioning |
| **Direct consumers** | Health-conscious, culinary enthusiasts | Online, farmers markets |

### Domestic Pricing (MXN)

| Product Type | Retail (MXN/kg) | USD Equivalent |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Standard artisanal | 200-400 | $11-22 |
| Premium sea salt | 400-700 | $22-39 |
| Flor de Sal | 500-1,000+ | $28-56+ |
| Ultra-premium | 900-1,800 | $50-100 |

Wholesale typically 30-50% below retail.

## Existing Competition

### Colima (Dominant Mexican Region)

Colima has 500+ years of documented salt-making tradition and multiple established brands:

| Brand | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Sal Rey de Colima** | 400+ family cooperative, Kosher certified |
| **Colima Salt Co.** | 1,000-year Aztec techniques marketing |
| **Marisal/Dos Soles** | Cooperative since 1925 |
| **XOLO Mexican Exports** | Traditional Cuyutlán Lagoon |

**Colima dominates the "Mexican artisanal salt" narrative.**

### Baja California (Underdeveloped)

| Player | Scale | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Exportadora de Sal (ESSA)** | 8-9M tonnes/year | Industrial only, exports to Japan. NOT a competitor. |
| **Baja Gold Salt Co.** | Small artisanal | Sea of Cortez, mineral-rich positioning |
| **Alebrixes** | Small | Amazon presence |

**Opportunity:** "Baja Pacific salt" lacks brand recognition — room to build regional identity.

### Competitive Advantage

| Factor | Your Position |
|--------|---------------|
| **Sustainability** | Zero-waste circular system — salt is useful byproduct, not disposal problem |
| **Pacific Ocean terroir** | Different mineral profile than lagoon/Sea of Cortez salt |
| **Baja identity** | BajaMed cuisine connection, underutilized regional brand |
| **Story** | Part of integrated solar-powered coastal homestead |

## Export Markets

### Where Mexican Salt Currently Goes

| Destination | Annual Value (USD) |
|-------------|-------------------|
| United States | $13.9M |
| El Salvador | $1.16M |
| Belize | $618K |
| Guatemala | $418K |
| Peru | $191K |

Mexico is the **4th largest salt exporter globally**.

### Major Gourmet Salt Import Markets

| Region | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Japan** | Top importer, 6.6% CAGR growth, sophisticated premium market |
| **China** | Growing premium food market |
| **South Korea** | Significant gourmet consumer |
| **European Union** | Strong artisanal demand, new organic salt rules |

### Export Certifications

| Certification | Market | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| **COFEPRIS sanitary registration** | Mexico, Latin America | Required baseline |
| **Kosher** | Global | Relatively easy to obtain |
| **EU food safety compliance** | Europe | e-COI via TRACES system |

**Note on organic:** Salt cannot be certified organic (it's a mineral, not agricultural product). However, France approved EU's first organic salt specification in 2024 — worth monitoring.

### Logistics from Baja

**Port of Ensenada** — Major commercial port, container shipping to international destinations

For small volumes: Air freight viable for high-value orders

## Sales Channels

### For a 7-9 Tonne/Year Producer

| Channel | Volume | Margin | Effort | Best For |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|----------|
| **Farmers markets** | 5-50 kg/month | High | High (time) | Brand building, feedback |
| **Online D2C** | 50-500 kg/month | High | Medium | Consistent revenue |
| **Local restaurants** | 20-100 kg/month | Medium-High | Medium | Credibility, word-of-mouth |
| **Regional distributors** | 200-500 kg/month | Lower | Lower | Scale without logistics burden |
| **Resort retail** | Variable | High | Medium | Tourist market, premium pricing |

### Recommended Channel Mix (Year 1-2)

| Channel | % of Volume | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Direct restaurant/chef | 40% | Build relationships with Baja/CDMX chefs |
| Online (own site + Amazon MX) | 30% | Consistent baseline revenue |

### Scale Reference

**Jacobsen Salt Co. (Oregon):** Produces 8,165 kg/month (18,000 lbs) with 42 employees, supplies Williams Sonoma, Whole Foods, thousands of retailers.

Your 600-750 kg/month is ~10% of Jacobsen's volume — appropriate for 1-2 person sales operation.

## Differentiation Strategy

### What Makes Salt "Premium"

| Factor | Your Position |
|--------|---------------|
| **Origin story** | Solar-harvested, Baja Pacific, pristine waters |
| **Sustainability** | Zero-waste desalination system, solar-powered |
| **Mineral profile** | Pacific Ocean trace minerals |
| **Production method** | Solar evaporation, hand-harvested |
| **Terroir** | Baja California — BajaMed cuisine connection |
| **Integrated story** | Part of self-sufficient coastal homestead |

### Framing the Desalination Origin

**Avoid:** "Byproduct," "waste stream," "leftover"

**Use instead:**
- "Solar-purified Pacific sea salt"
- "Double-filtered through reverse osmosis"
- "From our zero-waste coastal system"
- "Crystallized from purified Baja seawater"

**The sustainability angle is a positive** if framed as intentional circular design, not incidental waste recovery.

## Revenue Projections

### Conservative Scenario (Wholesale Focus)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Annual production | 7 tonnes |
| Average price | $12/kg (wholesale) |
| **Annual revenue** | **$84,000** |
| Primary channels | Distributors, bulk restaurant |

### Moderate Scenario (Mixed Channels)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Annual production | 7 tonnes |
| Average price | $25/kg (blended) |
| **Annual revenue** | **$175,000** |
| Primary channels | Restaurants, online, some retail |

### Optimistic Scenario (Premium Brand)

| Metric | Value |

| Annual production | 7 tonnes |
| Average price | $45/kg (premium retail) |
| **Annual revenue** | **$315,000** |

### Reality Check

Achieving premium pricing ($40-50+/kg) requires:
- Strong brand and packaging
- Consistent quality

- Effective storytelling (origin, sustainability, purity)
- Time to build reputation (2-3 years typically)

**Year 1 realistic target:** $80,000-120,000 (wholesale + some direct)
**Year 3 potential:** $150,000-250,000 (established brand, diversified channels)

2. **Colima dominates "Mexican artisanal salt"** — but Baja Pacific is differentiated and underutilized

3. **Frame desalination as "solar-harvested," not "byproduct"** — sustainability is a positive story

4. **7-9 tonnes/year is boutique scale** — appropriate for direct sales and regional distribution, not mass retail

5. **Resort/tourist market is accessible** — Los Cabos is nearby and hungry for local premium products

6. **Price premium is 100-1000x over commodity** — the market rewards quality positioning

7. **$80K-120K Year 1 revenue is realistic** — with path to $200K+ as brand develops
