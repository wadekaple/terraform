- **NOM-051-SCFI/SSA1-2010:** Labeling requirements for pre-packaged foods
- Minimum **97% NaCl content** (dry matter basis)

### Market Size

Latin America Gourmet Salt Market: **$0.71 billion (2024)** → projected **$1.27 billion by 2033** (6.66% CAGR)

Mexico is a primary growth driver alongside Brazil.

### Buyer Segments

| Segment | Characteristics | Access Strategy |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **High-end restaurants** | Mexico City, resort areas, BajaMed cuisine | Chef relationships, Mercado San Juan |
| **Specialty food stores** | CDMX, Guadalajara, Monterrey, Los Cabos | Direct distribution |

## Existing Competition

### Colima (Dominant Mexican Region)

Colima has 500+ years of documented salt-making tradition and multiple established brands:

| Brand | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Sal Rey de Colima** | 400+ family cooperative, Kosher certified |
| **Colima Salt Co.** | 1,000-year Aztec techniques marketing |
| **Marisal/Dos Soles** | Cooperative since 1925 |
| **XOLO Mexican Exports** | Traditional Cuyutlán Lagoon |

**Colima dominates the "Mexican artisanal salt" narrative.**

### Baja California (Underdeveloped)

| Player | Scale | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Exportadora de Sal (ESSA)** | 8-9M tonnes/year | Industrial only, exports to Japan. NOT a competitor. |
| **Baja Gold Salt Co.** | Small artisanal | Sea of Cortez, mineral-rich positioning |
| **Alebrixes** | Small | Amazon presence |

**Opportunity:** "Baja Pacific salt" lacks brand recognition — room to build regional identity.

### Competitive Advantage

| Factor | Your Position |
|--------|---------------|
| **Sustainability** | Zero-waste circular system — salt is useful byproduct, not disposal problem |
| **Pacific Ocean terroir** | Different mineral profile than lagoon/Sea of Cortez salt |
| **Baja identity** | BajaMed cuisine connection, underutilized regional brand |
| **Story** | Part of integrated solar-powered coastal homestead |

|-------------|-------------------|
| United States | $13.9M |
| El Salvador | $1.16M |
| Belize | $618K |
| Guatemala | $418K |
| Peru | $191K |

Mexico is the **4th largest salt exporter globally**.

### Major Gourmet Salt Import Markets

| Region | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Japan** | Top importer, 6.6% CAGR growth, sophisticated premium market |
| **China** | Growing premium food market |
| **South Korea** | Significant gourmet consumer |
| **European Union** | Strong artisanal demand, new organic salt rules |

### Export Certifications

| Certification | Market | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| **COFEPRIS sanitary registration** | Mexico, Latin America | Required baseline |

| **EU food safety compliance** | Europe | e-COI via TRACES system |

**Note on organic:** Salt cannot be certified organic (it's a mineral, not agricultural product). However, France approved EU's first organic salt specification in 2024 — worth monitoring.

### Logistics from Baja

**Port of Ensenada** — Major commercial port, container shipping to international destinations

For small volumes: Air freight viable for high-value orders

## Sales Channels

### For a 7-9 Tonne/Year Producer

| Channel | Volume | Margin | Effort | Best For |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|----------|
| **Farmers markets** | 5-50 kg/month | High | High (time) | Brand building, feedback |
| **Online D2C** | 50-500 kg/month | High | Medium | Consistent revenue |
| **Local restaurants** | 20-100 kg/month | Medium-High | Medium | Credibility, word-of-mouth |
| **Regional distributors** | 200-500 kg/month | Lower | Lower | Scale without logistics burden |
| **Resort retail** | Variable | High | Medium | Tourist market, premium pricing |

### Recommended Channel Mix (Year 1-2)

| Channel | % of Volume | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Direct restaurant/chef | 40% | Build relationships with Baja/CDMX chefs |
| Online (own site + Amazon MX) | 30% | Consistent baseline revenue |

## Differentiation Strategy

### What Makes Salt "Premium"

| Factor | Your Position |
|--------|---------------|
| **Origin story** | Solar-harvested, Baja Pacific, pristine waters |
| **Sustainability** | Zero-waste desalination system, solar-powered |
| **Mineral profile** | Pacific Ocean trace minerals |
| **Production method** | Solar evaporation, hand-harvested |
| **Terroir** | Baja California — BajaMed cuisine connection |
| **Integrated story** | Part of self-sufficient coastal homestead |

### Framing the Desalination Origin

**Avoid:** "Byproduct," "waste stream," "leftover"

**Use instead:**
- "Solar-purified Pacific sea salt"
- "Double-filtered through reverse osmosis"
- "From our zero-waste coastal system"
- "Crystallized from purified Baja seawater"

**The sustainability angle is a positive** if framed as intentional circular design, not incidental waste recovery.

## Revenue Projections

### Conservative Scenario (Wholesale Focus)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Annual production | 7 tonnes |
| Average price | $12/kg (wholesale) |
| **Annual revenue** | **$84,000** |
| Primary channels | Distributors, bulk restaurant |

### Moderate Scenario (Mixed Channels)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Annual production | 7 tonnes |
| Average price | $25/kg (blended) |
| **Annual revenue** | **$175,000** |
| Primary channels | Restaurants, online, some retail |

### Optimistic Scenario (Premium Brand)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Annual production | 7 tonnes |
| Average price | $45/kg (premium retail) |
| **Annual revenue** | **$315,000** |
| Primary channels | Direct retail, resort, online premium |

### Reality Check: Market Entry Timelines

Achieving premium pricing ($40-50+/kg) requires:
- Strong brand and packaging
- Consistent quality
- Chef endorsements / culinary credibility
- Effective storytelling (origin, sustainability, purity)
- Time to build reputation (2-3 years typically)

**Market entry takes time.** Distribution relationships, brand recognition, and premium pricing don't happen overnight. Two realistic scenarios:

#### Optimistic Scenario (Fast Market Entry)
Assumes strong network, prior relationships, or exceptional marketing:
- **Year 1:** $80,000-120,000 (wholesale + some direct retail)
- **Year 2:** $120,000-175,000 (expanding distribution)
- **Year 3:** $150,000-250,000 (established brand, diversified channels)

#### Conservative Scenario (Typical Market Entry)
More realistic timeline for new producer without existing network:
- **Year 1:** $20,000-40,000 (farmers markets, bulk commodity $0.40-0.80/kg, initial retail)
- **Year 2:** $50,000-80,000 (regional distribution beginning, some premium accounts)
- **Year 3:** $100,000-150,000 (established regional presence, growing brand)
- **Year 5:** $200,000-300,000 (mature market position, premium pricing established)

**Why conservative scenario is likely:**
- Certifications and permits take 3-6 months (delays Year 1 sales)
- Shelf space/distribution agreements take 6-12 months to establish
- Premium pricing requires proven track record (1-2 years minimum)
- Initial sales will be heavily commodity/wholesale priced

**Good news:** Even the conservative scenario is profitable:
- **Year 3 example:** $100K revenue - $10K operating costs - $12K labor (520 hrs @ $23/hr) = **$78K net profit**
- **Capital payback:** $15K startup ÷ $78K profit = **2.3 months**
- System economics remain strong even with slower market development

## Startup Costs (Salt Business Only)

| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| COFEPRIS registration | $500-1,500 | Sanitary permit |
| Packaging design | $1,000-3,000 | Labels, bags, boxes |
| Initial packaging inventory | $2,000-5,000 | Bags, labels, containers |
| Lab testing (purity, heavy metals) | $300-500 | Initial certification |
| Website/e-commerce | $500-2,000 | Basic Shopify or similar |
| Marketing materials | $500-1,500 | Photography, copy |
| **Total startup** | **$5,000-14,000** | |

### Ongoing Costs

| Item | Annual Cost | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Packaging materials | $3,000-6,000 | ~$0.50-1.00/unit |
| Lab testing | $500-1,000 | Quarterly batches |
| Marketing | $2,000-5,000 | Variable |
| Shipping supplies | $1,000-3,000 | Depends on D2C volume |
| **Total materials/overhead** | **$6,500-15,000** | |

### Labor Requirements

| Activity | Time | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Gypsum harvest (rooftop) | Every 8 days, 2-3 hrs | Concentrator ponds, can schedule for cool hours |
| Salt harvest (rooftop via chute) | Weekly, 1-2 hrs | Incremental 200 kg harvest, gravity chute to ground |
| Processing, washing, packaging | 2-4 hrs/week | At ground level after chute collection |
| Sales, marketing, customer service | 3-6 hrs/week | More in early years |
| **Total time** | **10-15 hrs/week** | **520-780 hrs/year** |

**Labor opportunity cost:** At $20-25/hr, this represents $10,400-19,500/year in time value. However:
- Many activities can flex around other work (not rigid schedule)
- Harvest timing is predictable (plan weeks ahead)
- Processing can be batched
- Early morning/evening work avoids heat

**Important:** Labor cost is real even if unpaid (opportunity cost). Conservative economic scenario accounts for this ($12K-13K/year labor cost in profitability calculations).
