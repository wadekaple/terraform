    **This documentation was created with assistance from Claude AI (Anthropic).**

    While the technical calculations, research, and system designs have been developed through rigorous analysis, readers should be aware of the following:

    - **Verify calculations independently** - All engineering calculations, energy budgets, and production estimates should be validated by qualified professionals before implementation
    - **Regulatory compliance** - Local regulations, permits, and safety standards must be verified for your specific jurisdiction
    - **Site-specific adaptation required** - Designs are conceptual and must be adapted to local conditions, resources, and constraints
    - **No warranties** - This documentation is provided for research and educational purposes only, with no guarantees of accuracy or suitability for any particular application
    - **Consult experts** - Always engage qualified engineers, architects, agricultural specialists, and other professionals before implementing any system described here

    The usual caveats for AI-generated content apply: information may contain errors, omissions, or outdated assumptions. Use this documentation as a starting point for further research and professional consultation, not as a complete implementation guide.

## 🌊 Core Concept

**Using renewable energy to desalinate seawater for sustainable settlements and agriculture in coastal desert regions.**

This project explores how solar-powered desalination can transform coastal desert areas into productive agricultural systems, creating food security and sustainable settlements where conventional agriculture isn't viable.

---

## 🎯 Two System Models

### Homestead-Scale System (Current Focus)

**Scale:** Self-sufficient operation for <10 people

- **Water:** 0.6 m³/day (600 L/day) via RO desalination
- **Energy:** ~6 kWh/day electrical + 28 kWh/day thermal (14 m² solar thermal collectors)
- **Agriculture:** 100 m² aquaponics + 24 chickens + 10 ruminants (5 sheep, 5 goats)
- **Key Innovations:** Rooftop salt ponds (194 m²) provide 273 kWh/day evaporative cooling + bermed earth-sheltered architecture + seawater cooling loop eliminate all evaporative water consumption

**[→ Explore Homestead System](research/homestead-scale-system.md)**

### Industrial-Scale System

**Scale:** Export agriculture model

- **Water:** 923 m³/day desalination capacity
- **Energy:** 1 acre solar array
- **Output:** Feeds 7,000+ people through vegetable exports
- **Challenge:** Brine disposal and scaling complexity

## 🔑 Key Design Innovations

### 1. Seawater Cooling Loop
Zero fresh water consumption for climate control by circulating seawater through building floors and walls.

### 2. Brine-to-Salt Production
Transform RO reject brine from waste stream to revenue stream through fractional crystallization. Produces 11+ tonnes/year food-grade sea salt.

### 3. Zero-Irrigation Livestock Feed
Feed animals entirely from ocean resources (seaweed) and rainfall-fed browse (prickly pear, saltbush). No freshwater irrigation required.

### 4. Earth-Sheltered Multi-Structure Design
Strategic use of partial earth-sheltering and green roofs provides passive climate control while maintaining natural light and ventilation.

### 5. Thermal-Electric Hybrid Energy
Solar PV for electrical loads, solar thermal for DHW, refrigeration, and processing heat. Cheaper thermal storage (hot water) vs expensive battery storage.

## 🌍 Target Regions

**Primary Focus:** Baja California Pacific coast

**Applicable to any coastal desert region with:**
- High solar radiation (5+ kWh/m²/day)
- Seawater access
- Limited freshwater resources
- Potential examples: Western Sahara, coastal Peru/Chile, Arabian Peninsula, Australian coast

## 📈 Economics

### Homestead System Capital Cost
**$80,000-160,000** (varies with DIY vs contractor build)

### Operating Costs
**$3,060-5,210/year** ($255-435/month)

### Revenue Potential
**$60,000-190,000/year** from salt production alone (wholesale gourmet pricing)

**Net Result:** Strong positive cash flow after initial investment
