The author proposes transforming arid coastal regions by leveraging renewable energy sources like solar and wind power to convert seawater into fresh water. This approach would support both human settlements and agricultural development in currently sparsely populated areas.

The author emphasizes this isn't intended as a profit-generating venture but rather as humanitarian and ecological infrastructure. Benefits would include:

- Carbon sequestration through plant-based agriculture
- Job creation
- Housing provision
- Food production in underdeveloped regions

The proposal prioritizes environmental and procedural sustainability to ensure long-term viability with minimal ongoing financial requirements.
