## Overview

This page discusses sea channels as a critical component of the larger terraforming concept for coastal deserts using renewable desalination technology.

## Primary Functions

The blog outlines three primary purposes for sea channels in this system:

### 1. Ecosystem Support

"A series of sea channels throughout the operation could provide a number of functions. Firstly, they could support a maritime ecosystem, even if they were inland."

This would generate diverse seafood resources including:
- Fish
- Crustaceans
- Mollusks
- Seaweed

### 2. Water Supply

The channels would deliver consistent seawater to desalination facilities for processing, creating a reliable supply chain for the freshwater production system.

### 3. Bio-filtration

The final channel section would use fine mesh filters containing flora that provides preliminary water filtration before distillation begins. This natural filtration reduces the burden on the mechanical desalination systems.

## Energy Considerations

The proposal identifies **water elevation as a major energy demand** for maintaining the channel system.

### Proposed Solution

Combining traditional water transport methods—specifically **Archimedes screws**—with available wind energy. This approach would:

- Leverage mechanical energy directly
- Avoid converting between mechanical and electrical forms
- Potentially improve overall efficiency

By using wind power to drive Archimedes screws directly, the system minimizes energy losses that would occur through electrical conversion, making the water transport more sustainable and efficient.

## Integration

The sea channels serve as a connecting element between the desalination facilities, organic farming operations, and the natural coastal environment, creating a holistic ecosystem that supports both food production and environmental sustainability.
