# Design Documents

This folder contains integrated designs that combine multiple specifications into cohesive operational plans.

## What Goes Here

Design documents show how different systems work together:
- Settlement layouts
- Process integration
- Operational workflows
- Scaling plans
- Implementation phases

## Current Designs

*None yet - create as you integrate multiple systems*

## Planned Designs

Based on [Development Roadmap](../00-development-roadmap.md):

### Phase 2: Implementation Designs
- [ ] `mvp-settlement-layout.md` - Minimum viable settlement design
- [ ] `modular-expansion-pattern.md` - How to scale from 1x to 10x
- [ ] `phase-1-implementation-plan.md` - First build sequence

### Phase 3: Integration Designs
- [ ] `energy-water-integration.md` - How energy and water systems connect
- [ ] `agriculture-waste-integration.md` - Closed-loop nutrient cycling
- [ ] `community-operations-plan.md` - Daily operational workflows
- [ ] `emergency-response-design.md` - Resilience and backup systems

### Site-Specific Designs
- [ ] `western-sahara-pilot-design.md` - Complete pilot project design
- [ ] `baja-peninsula-adaptation.md` - Adaptations for different site

## How to Use Templates

1. Copy `TEMPLATE-design.md`
2. Rename to your design (e.g., `mvp-settlement-layout.md`)
3. Reference multiple specifications
4. Show integration and interactions
5. Include visual diagrams
6. Provide operational scenarios

**Tip:** Design docs are created AFTER you have relevant specs. They pull together the pieces. Don't design before you spec.
