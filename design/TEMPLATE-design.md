## Operational Scenarios

### Normal Operations
*How the system functions day-to-day*

**Daily Cycle:**
- Morning: ...
- Midday: ...
- Evening: ...
- Night: ...

**Seasonal Variations:**
- Summer: ...
- Winter: ...

### Startup/Shutdown
*How the system begins and ends operations*

### Emergency Scenarios
*How the system handles abnormal conditions*

## Scaling Considerations

### Minimum Viable Scale
- Population: X people
- Area: Y hectares
- Production: Z units/day

### Expansion Patterns
- How to grow from 1x to 2x
- How to grow from 2x to 5x
- Maximum practical scale

### Modular Design Elements
- What can be replicated
- What must scale proportionally
- What remains fixed
