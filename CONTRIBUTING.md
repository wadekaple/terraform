# Contributing to the Coastal Desert Terraforming Project

**Thank you for your interest in this project!** This documentation represents a design exploration for renewable energy-powered coastal desert settlements, and it **desperately needs expert validation**.

## 🚨 Critical Context

**This is AI-assisted research** created with Claude AI (Anthropic). While the calculations and reasoning are detailed, they are **unverified by domain experts** and should not be used for implementation without professional review.

**We need YOUR expertise** to validate, correct, and improve this work.

## Current Open Questions

### 🤔 Questions We're Actively Researching

1. **Can rooftop salt ponds realistically provide 338 kWh/day of passive cooling?** ([rooftop-salt-pond-design.md](research/rooftop-salt-pond-design.md))
   - Evaporation calculation seems high - is this realistic in practice?
   - Are there other heat transfer mechanisms we're missing?

2. **Is 20-30% seaweed in ruminant diet actually safe long-term?** ([seaweed-feed-feasibility.md](research/seaweed-feed-feasibility.md))
   - Iodine toxicity concerns
   - Salt accumulation in tissues
   - Need veterinary review

3. **Are our RO energy estimates realistic?** ([desalination-energy-efficiency.md](research/desalination-energy-efficiency.md))
   - Using 2.5-3.5 kWh/m³ for seawater RO
   - Does this account for real-world inefficiencies?

4. **Can we really achieve $20-40/kg for artisanal salt?** ([salt-market-analysis.md](research/salt-market-analysis.md))
   - Market positioning assumptions
   - Competition analysis
   - Distribution challenges

5. **Is the structural loading for rooftop ponds acceptable?** ([rooftop-salt-pond-design.md](research/rooftop-salt-pond-design.md))
   - 230 kg/m² on commercial roof structure
   - Need civil engineer review
   - Seismic considerations for Baja

6. **Are our cost estimates anywhere close to reality?** ([capital-costs-estimate.md](research/capital-costs-estimate.md), [homestead-scale-system.md](research/homestead-scale-system.md))
   - $79,800-160,100 for complete homestead system
   - Mexican construction cost assumptions
   - Equipment pricing validation needed

## How to Submit Feedback

### Option 1: GitHub Issues (Easiest)

[Create a new issue](https://github.com/wadekaple/terraform/issues/new) with:

- **Title:** Brief description (e.g., "Error in RO energy calculation")
- **Document:** Link to specific file and section
- **Issue:** What's wrong or questionable
- **Suggestion:** How to fix it (if you have one)

**Example:**
```
Title: Seaweed dietary percentage seems too high

Document: research/seaweed-feed-feasibility.md, line 245

Issue: The document claims 20-30% seaweed in ruminant diet is safe,
but research I've seen suggests 10-15% maximum due to iodine toxicity.

Reference: Smith et al. (2020) found thyroid issues at >15% seaweed
inclusion in sheep diets.

Suggestion: Reduce to 10-15% maximum and recalculate feed budget.
```

### Option 2: GitHub Discussions (For Detailed Review)

For comprehensive expert review or longer discussions:

- **Start a discussion** in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/wadekaple/terraform/discussions)
- Review an entire subsystem (e.g., all aquaponics documents)
- Provide detailed technical feedback
- Discuss alternative approaches
- We'll credit you prominently in the documentation

**Perfect for:** Multi-part feedback, open-ended questions, exploring design alternatives
