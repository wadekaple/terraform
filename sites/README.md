# Site Studies

This folder contains location-specific analysis and adaptation plans.

## Structure

Each site gets its own folder with:
- README.md (site overview)
- Resource assessments
- Site-specific designs
- Implementation plans
- Local considerations

## Potential Sites

Based on [My Idea](../02-my-idea.md):

### Western Sahara
- [ ] Create `western-sahara/` folder
- [ ] Site overview and selection rationale
- [ ] Resource assessment (solar, wind, water)
- [ ] Terrain and geology analysis
- [ ] Infrastructure connectivity
- [ ] Regulatory and social considerations
- [ ] Adapted designs

### Baja Peninsula
- [ ] Create `baja-peninsula/` folder
- [ ] Site overview and selection rationale
- [ ] Resource assessment
- [ ] Terrain and geology analysis
- [ ] Infrastructure connectivity
- [ ] Regulatory and social considerations
- [ ] Adapted designs

## When to Create Site Studies

Create site-specific folders when:
- You've completed core specs and designs (general case)
- You're ready to adapt to a specific location
- You need to gather location-specific data
- You're preparing for actual implementation

Don't create site studies too early:
- General specs aren't complete yet
- You don't know what questions to ask
- Design principles aren't established

**Recommended:** Complete at least Priority 1-3 from the roadmap before diving into site-specific work.
