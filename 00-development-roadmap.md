## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks - Homestead Scale

**✅ MITIGATED:**
- **Aquaponics water budget underestimate:** Conservative 100-150 L/day estimate (was 40-80 L/day)
- **BSF feed efficiency on high-fiber substrates:** Pivot to mushrooms for manure, BSFL for SMS/food waste
- **Seaweed dietary limits for ruminants:** Capped at 20-30% (not 50%), validated with research

**🔄 MONITORING:**
- **Baja seawater heavy metals:** Testing required before nigari production (arsenic, lead, cadmium)
- **Salt quality and purity:** Monthly testing for food-grade standards
- **RO membrane fouling:** Seawater pre-filtration and regular backwashing

### Technical Risks - Expansion Scale

**✅ ADDRESSED:**
- **MED calcium carbonate scaling:** PASP anti-scalant + 60°C operation + monthly CIP cleaning
- **Gypsum availability misconception:** Corrected - IS available at current scale (730-1,095 kg/year)

**🔄 TO ADDRESS:**
- **Three Sisters water use variance:** Trial plot validates 4 m³/day projection before full expansion
- **Corn stalk substrate quality:** Test mushroom yields on corn stalks vs purchased straw
- **MED anti-scalant sourcing:** Identify Mexican suppliers for food-grade PASP before implementation

### Social/Operational Risks

**🔄 TO PLAN:**
- **Operator training:** Complex systems require skilled management (aquaponics, RO, MED, mushrooms)
- **Single points of failure:** Backup plans for RO membrane failure, solar equipment damage
- **Population growth management:** Phased housing expansion to match food/water capacity
- **Skills redundancy:** Multiple operators trained on each critical system

## Key Insights & Lessons Learned

### Design Philosophy Shift

**From:** "1 acre of solar → how much can we produce?" (industrial/export model)
**To:** "What agriculture do we want → how much infrastructure?" (homestead/self-sufficiency model)

**Result:** More practical, buildable design at <$130K capital vs millions for industrial scale.

### Critical Discoveries

1. **Seawater cooling eliminates the #1 water consumer:** Evaporative cooling (750-1,100 L/day) replaced with free ocean heat sink.

2. **Mushrooms > BSFL for high-fiber manure:** Ruminant manure is poor BSFL substrate; mushrooms extract value then pass SMS to BSFL.

3. **Brine is a product, not waste:** Salt production ($14k-90k/year) + byproducts (CaCO₃, gypsum, bitterns) turn liability into asset.

4. **MED scaling is THE critical issue:** Thermal desalination requires anti-scaling or equipment fails rapidly; PASP solution is food-safe and effective.

5. **Agriculture-first sizing is more accurate:** Starting from desired food production backward to infrastructure is more intuitive than energy-first.

6. **Expandability must be designed upfront:** Oversizing manifolds, foundations, and plumbing ($1,500-3,000 premium) saves $2,000-5,000 in rework later.

### Integration Synergies Discovered

- Corn stalks from Three Sisters → Mushroom substrate (replaces purchased straw)
- Spent mushroom substrate → BSFL feed → Frass → Aquaponics/field crops
- Gypsum from salt production → Soil conditioning (free byproduct)
- Solar thermal for mushrooms → Expands to MED (dual-purpose infrastructure)
- Seawater cooling → Pre-warms RO feed (cascading energy use)

## Questions for Future Investigation

### Technical

- [ ] Can BSFL tolerate higher seaweed percentages if adapted over multiple generations?
- [ ] Optimal mushroom species mix for year-round production in 24-28°C stable environment?
- [ ] Does nigari from Baja Pacific seawater pass heavy metals testing for food safety?
- [ ] Can MED operate below 60°C (50-55°C) to further reduce scaling risk?
- [ ] What is the minimum viable MED unit size (smaller than 5 m³/day)?

### Economic

- [ ] What is the premium market willing to pay for "ocean-enriched" eggs (from seaweed-fed chickens)?
- [ ] Can artisanal Baja Pacific salt command $20-50/kg retail consistently?
- [ ] Is nigari production at $10-30/kg viable at homestead scale (8-16 tonnes/year potential)?
- [ ] What is the actual payback period with real-world construction costs?

### Social/Operational

- [ ] What skills mix is optimal for <10 operators (generalists vs specialists)?
- [ ] How many hours per week does homestead system require for steady-state operation?
- [ ] What is the learning curve for aquaponics + mushrooms + livestock management?
- [ ] Can the system operate with lower operator density (6-8 vs 10)?

### Scaling

- [ ] Does community scale (25-35 people) have better economics than homestead scale?
- [ ] Is village scale (100-500 people) desirable, or does it lose the advantages of small scale?
- [ ] Can multiple homestead units federate without centralizing infrastructure?

## Notes & Insights

**2026-02-06:** Completed comprehensive homestead-scale system design with major architectural revision. Key milestone: All major technical challenges addressed (water budget, energy budget, nutrient cycling, scaling prevention, byproduct utilization). **Design Update:** Changed from multi-level underground facility to three separate single-level structures (greenhouse with partial earth-sheltering, processing building with green roof, livestock shelter with green roof). This reduces construction complexity, lowers costs ($75-149K vs original $63-126K for more realistic estimate), improves animal welfare, and allows phased construction. System is theoretically sound and ready for implementation planning. Next phase: Trial plot (Three Sisters) and heavy metals testing (bitterns/nigari).

**Key realization:** The homestead scale (10-20 people) may be the optimal scale for this model. Larger scales introduce complexity (governance, coordination, single points of failure) without proportional benefits. Consider federation of homestead units rather than village-scale centralization.

**Integration insight:** Every waste stream has been successfully valorized:
- RO brine → Salt + byproducts (CaCO₃, gypsum, bitterns)
- Manure → Mushrooms → SMS → BSFL → Frass → Back to crops
- Aquaponics waste → BSFL substrate
- Seaweed scraps → BSFL substrate
- Food scraps → BSFL substrate
- Corn stalks → Mushroom substrate
True zero-waste system achieved at homestead scale.
