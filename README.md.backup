## Document Types Guide

### **Concept Documents** (Current level)
- **Purpose:** Communicate the vision and high-level approach
- **Length:** 1-3 pages
- **Audience:** Anyone interested in the concept
- **Updates:** Infrequent (only when core concept evolves)

### **Technical Specifications**
- **Purpose:** Engineering details for implementation
- **Length:** As needed (can be extensive)
- **Audience:** Engineers, builders, technical reviewers
- **Updates:** Frequent during development
- **Example:** `specs/energy-system-specification.md`

### **Research Documents**
- **Purpose:** Data collection, calculations, analysis
- **Length:** Variable
- **Audience:** Yourself, technical validators
- **Updates:** Continuous as research progresses
- **Example:** `research/solar-resource-analysis-western-sahara.md`

### **Design Documents**
- **Purpose:** Integration of multiple systems, detailed planning
- **Length:** 5-20 pages typically
- **Audience:** Implementation teams
- **Updates:** Iterative refinement
- **Example:** `design/settlement-layout-mvp.md`

### **Site Studies**
- **Purpose:** Location-specific analysis and adaptation
- **Length:** Comprehensive (10-30 pages)
- **Audience:** Site developers, local stakeholders
- **Updates:** Per-site basis
- **Example:** `sites/western-sahara-pilot/README.md`

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Concept Phase** (Current)
   - Keep concept docs at overview level
   - Don't add too much detail yet
   - Focus on breadth of coverage

2. **Deep Dive Phase** (When ready)
   - Create folder for the area (e.g., `/specs/energy/`)
   - Put detailed work in that folder
   - Link from concept doc to detailed docs

3. **Integration Phase**
   - Create `/design/` documents that pull together multiple specs
   - Show how systems interact
   - Keep integration docs updated as specs evolve

4. **Implementation Phase**
   - Create `/sites/` folders for specific locations
   - Site docs reference specs and designs
   - Adapt general specs to site-specific conditions

## Linking Strategy

### In Concept Documents
```markdown
For detailed engineering specifications, see [Energy System Spec](specs/energy-system-specification.md).
```

### In Technical Documents
```markdown
This specification supports the vision described in [Renewable Desalination](../03-renewable-desalination.md).
```

### In Design Documents
```markdown
This design integrates:
- [Energy System Spec](../specs/energy-system-specification.md)
- [Water Distribution Spec](../specs/water-distribution-specification.md)
- [Farming Facility Spec](../specs/organic-farming-specification.md)
```

## Document Naming Conventions

### Concept Docs (Root Level)
- `01-an-idea.md` - Numbered, short names
- `00-development-roadmap.md` - Special docs start with 00

### Specs (Technical)
- `specs/energy-system-specification.md` - Descriptive, kebab-case
- `specs/energy/solar-thermal-design.md` - Can nest by topic

### Research
- `research/2026-02-western-sahara-solar-data.md` - Include date if time-sensitive
- `research/desalination-efficiency-comparison.md` - Topic-focused

### Designs
- `design/mvp-settlement-layout.md` - Clear purpose
- `design/phase-1-implementation-plan.md` - Numbered phases

### Sites
- `sites/western-sahara/README.md` - Each site gets folder
- `sites/western-sahara/resource-assessment.md` - Site-specific docs
- `sites/baja-peninsula/README.md`

---

## When to Create New Folders

Create a new folder when:
- ✅ You have 3+ related documents
- ✅ A topic needs multiple supporting documents
- ✅ Clear hierarchical relationship exists
- ✅ You want to keep related research together

Don't create folders prematurely:
- ❌ Only 1-2 docs exist for a topic
- ❌ "Might need it later" (create when actually needed)
- ❌ Over-categorization (too many small folders)

---

## Maintenance

### Weekly
- [ ] Update roadmap with completed tasks
- [ ] Add new findings to research docs
- [ ] Link new documents into README

### Monthly
- [ ] Review document organization
- [ ] Consolidate or split docs if needed
- [ ] Update cross-references
- [ ] Archive outdated versions

### Quarterly
- [ ] Major structure review
- [ ] Reorganize if growth patterns changed
- [ ] Create new navigation aids if needed
