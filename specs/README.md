# Technical Specifications

This folder contains detailed engineering specifications for each major system.

## Existing Specifications

*None yet - create as you work through the roadmap priorities*

## Planned Specifications

Based on [Development Roadmap](../00-development-roadmap.md):

### Priority 1: Energy System
- [ ] `energy-system-specification.md` - Overall energy architecture
- [ ] `energy/solar-thermal-specification.md` - Solar thermal details
- [ ] `energy/solar-pv-specification.md` - Photovoltaic details
- [ ] `energy/wind-turbine-specification.md` - Wind power details
- [ ] `energy/energy-storage-specification.md` - Battery/thermal storage

### Priority 2: Water System
- [ ] `water-system-specification.md` - Overall water architecture
- [ ] `water/desalination-plant-specification.md` - Desalination details
- [ ] `water/distribution-network-specification.md` - Piping and delivery
- [ ] `water/storage-specification.md` - Tanks, reservoirs
- [ ] `water/greywater-recycling-specification.md` - Recycling system

### Priority 3: Agriculture
- [ ] `agriculture/greenhouse-specification.md`
- [ ] `agriculture/aquaponics-specification.md`
- [ ] `agriculture/livestock-specification.md`
- [ ] `agriculture/composting-specification.md`

### Priority 4: Infrastructure
- [ ] `infrastructure/sea-channels-specification.md`
- [ ] `infrastructure/roads-specification.md`
- [ ] `infrastructure/housing-specification.md`
- [ ] `infrastructure/utilities-specification.md`

## How to Use Templates

1. Copy `TEMPLATE-specification.md`
2. Rename to your topic (e.g., `energy-system-specification.md`)
3. Fill in each section systematically
4. Link to related research and design docs
5. Update this README when complete

---

**Tip:** Start broad (system-level) before going deep (component-level). Create `energy-system-specification.md` before creating `energy/solar-thermal-specification.md`.
