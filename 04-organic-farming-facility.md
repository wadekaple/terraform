## Overview

This page details a proposed organic farming facility concept as part of the larger terraforming initiative for coastal deserts using renewable desalination.

## Four Core Functions

The facility integrates four interconnected operations:

### 1. Greenhouse

Features hybrid aquaponics/hydroponics systems for producing "vegetables, herbs, spices, fruits, etc. as well as fish" with minimal water waste. This closed-loop system maximizes water efficiency while producing diverse crops.

### 2. Livestock

Houses chickens and sheep/goats for:
- Eggs
- Wool
- Milk production

The facility proposes using **seaweed as primary feed**, leveraging the maritime resources from the sea channels.

### 3. Composting

Processes waste using **black soldier fly larvae** to accelerate decomposition. The system provides multiple benefits:

- Larvae serve as high-protein livestock feed
- Outputs include worm tea for hydroponic systems
- Produces fertilizer products for commercial use

### 4. Mushrooms

Cultivated in compost for:
- Nutritional value
- Commercial export potential

## Air Circulation System

The design emphasizes continuous air flow through all sections, with integrated capture systems for:

- **Ammonia**: Dissolved in water to provide plant nutrients
- **Methane**: Could fuel additional energy production

This closed-loop approach to air quality management turns waste gases into valuable resources, further enhancing the sustainability of the entire facility.

## Integration

The facility is designed to work synergistically with the renewable desalination system and sea channels, creating a comprehensive sustainable agriculture ecosystem.
